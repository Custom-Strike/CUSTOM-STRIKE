## 📝 Frequently Asked Questions

***Can I play online with addons?***
> You can play with most mods on community servers, but joining official matchmaking will get you kicked (and result in competitive cooldown).

***Will I get VAC Banned for using addons?***
> No, as long as you don't use cheats like sv_pure bypassers and skin changers.
